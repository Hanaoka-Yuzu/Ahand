# Wechat Commission Platform

- Designed and built a WeChat applet with JavaScript and Java, which worked as a commission publishing platform.
- Created the UI pages and implemented components for commission display, commission receive and real-time chat. 
- Wrote message entity, mapper and service for real-time chat with WebSocket and REST. Enabled the system to automatically close the connection after a period of inactivity to reduce server load.
- Applied lazy loading for initial page loads, content compression (Gzip) for resource download and cache control for re-entering UI pages, reducing time to interactive (TTI) by 50%.
